Absolutely, focusing on the core idea of automatic binding site parsing and `let` injection using `rewrite-clj` and `clojure.tools.logging` is the right next step.  Let's solidify the flow and how these tools can bring it to life.

**Envisioned REPL Debugging Flow with Enhanced `spy+`:**

1.  **Mark Code with `spy+`**:  You wrap the code you want to debug with `(spy+ ...)` - it could be a function, a `let` block, a `do` block, or even an entire namespace (though namespace-level might be later).

    ```clojure
    (defn complex-function [data]
      (spy+
        (let [{:keys [items factor]} data
              processed-items (map #(* % factor) items)
              sum (reduce + processed-items)]
          (if (> sum 100)
            (str "Sum is large: " sum)
            (str "Sum is small: " sum)))))

    (complex-function {:items [10 20 30] :factor 2})
    ```

2.  **Run the Code in REPL**: You execute `(complex-function ...)` or any code containing `spy+` in your REPL session.

3.  **Automatic Binding Capture (Behind the Scenes)**:
    *   When the `eval` message hits the `spy-middleware`, it checks if `active-spy` is set (because of the `spy+` macro).
    *   If `active-spy` is active, the middleware uses `rewrite-clj` to parse the `code` string.
    *   It traverses the AST, identifying all binding forms (`let`, `let*`, `fn` parameters, etc.).
    *   For each binding, it extracts the symbol names.  `rewrite-clj` will be crucial for correctly handling destructuring.
    *   It constructs a `let` form that captures these symbols.  Something conceptually like:

        ```clojure
        (let [captured-var1 captured-var1-value
              captured-var2 captured-var2-value
              ...]
          original-form)
        ```
        Crucially, the `captured-var1-value` etc. are *not* evaluated at this stage. They will be evaluated when the *modified* form is actually `eval`ed by nREPL.

4.  **`let` Injection and Evaluation**:
    *   The middleware replaces the original code form with this newly constructed `let` form.
    *   nREPL then evaluates this *modified* form.  Because of the outer `let`, after the original code inside `spy+` runs, the captured variables are now bound in the REPL environment.

5.  **Instant REPL Access**: After the code runs, you can directly type and inspect any captured variable in your REPL:

    ```clojure
    items             ;; => [10 20 30]
    factor            ;; => 2
    processed-items   ;; => (20 40 60)
    sum               ;; => 120
    (reduce * processed-items) ;; => 48000
    ```

6.  **No `def-debug` Ever Again**:  You completely avoid the need to manually insert `(def var var)` or similar debugging `def` statements.  The `spy+` macro and middleware handle everything automatically.

**How `rewrite-clj` and `clojure.tools.logging` Come In:**

*   **`rewrite-clj`**:  This is the parsing and AST manipulation powerhouse.
    *   **Parsing**: `rewrite-clj.parse/parse-string` will convert the code string into an AST.
    *   **AST Traversal**:  `rewrite-clj.zip` (zipper) provides functions to navigate and analyze the AST. We'll use it to walk the tree and find binding nodes.
    *   **Binding Node Identification**: We need to identify `let`, `let*`, `fn`, `defn`, `loop`, `binding`, `with-redefs`, etc. nodes in the AST.
    *   **Symbol Extraction**:  For each binding node, `rewrite-clj.zip` will help us extract the symbols being bound, even within destructuring patterns.
    *   **Code Modification (Potentially)**:  While we might not *modify* the original code in the file, we'll use `rewrite-clj.zip` to *construct* the new `let` form that wraps the original code for evaluation in the REPL.

*   **`clojure.tools.logging`**:  Essential for debugging the middleware itself!
    *   **Logging Captured Bindings**:  Log the symbols and (perhaps initially) the *forms* that are being captured.  This helps verify that the AST traversal and binding site detection are working correctly.
    *   **Logging Modified Forms**: Log the `let`-injected form before it's evaluated. This helps understand exactly what the middleware is doing.
    *   **Error Logging**:  Use logging to capture any exceptions during parsing, AST traversal, or form modification within the middleware, making debugging much easier.

**Next Steps - Implementation Focus:**

1.  **AST Parsing and Traversal Experiment**: Start by playing with `rewrite-clj` in a scratch namespace.
    *   Parse a simple Clojure form with `let` and destructuring.
    *   Use `rewrite-clj.zip` to navigate the AST.
    *   Write code to identify `let` nodes and extract the bound symbols.
    *   Experiment with `clojure.walk/walk` or similar for AST traversal if zipper feels too complex initially.

2.  **Middleware Modification**:  In `spy-middleware` in `spy.clj`:
    *   Add `rewrite-clj` as a dependency to `spy/deps.edn`.
    *   Inside the `"eval"` case of `spy-middleware`, get the `code` string.
    *   Use `rewrite-clj.parse/parse-string` to get the AST.
    *   Implement a function to traverse the AST and extract binding symbols (start simple with just `let` initially, then expand to destructuring, etc.).
    *   Use `clojure.tools.logging` (add it to `spy/deps.edn` and `require` in `spy.clj`) to log the extracted symbols.
    *   For now, don't worry about `let` injection yet. Just focus on accurate parsing and binding site detection.

3.  **Basic Testing**:  Start with simple REPL tests. Run code with `spy+` and check the logs to see if the correct binding symbols are being captured.

By taking these focused steps, you'll progressively build the core functionality of automatic binding capture.  The key is to start small, verify each step with logging and basic testing, and then incrementally add more features like destructuring and `let` injection.  This iterative approach will make the ambitious goal much more manageable!
