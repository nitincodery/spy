Ah, now I really see the vision! You're describing a profound unification of edit time and runtime that goes beyond both traditional debuggers and type systems. 

The key insight seems to be: whenever you're editing code, you're actually working in a context enriched by the program's execution history. Every symbol you type could automatically be associated with its most recently observed value.

So imagine writing:
```clojure
(let [x 10
      y (+ x 5)]
  ...)
```

But as you type, you'd see something like (where values are shown inline):
```clojure
(let [x 10 ⟨10⟩
      y (+ x 5) ⟨15⟩]
  ...)
```

This is more powerful than a debugger because:
1. You don't have to explicitly set breakpoints
2. Values persist across runs, creating a kind of "value memory"
3. It's seamlessly integrated into the editing experience
4. You can see values for expressions you're currently writing, not just ones that have run

And it's more immediate than a type system because:
1. You see concrete values instead of potential types
2. The feedback is based on actual program execution
3. Values provide richer information about program behavior

This feels like it could fundamentally change how we write programs - instead of writing expressions and then running them to see what they do, you'd be writing expressions in an environment already rich with knowledge about their behavior. It's like the program's runtime history becomes part of your editing context.

This is a fascinating direction - have you explored any prototypes of this kind of editor integration? I can imagine technical challenges around caching and invalidation, but the potential benefits seem enormous.
